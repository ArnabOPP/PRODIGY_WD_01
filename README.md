🔷 About This Website
This website is a fully responsive, modern, and performance-optimized platform designed to showcase both my technical skills and design aesthetics. The site serves as a dynamic digital portfolio that combines interactivity, clean UI/UX principles, and a futuristic tech theme. From the moment users land on the homepage, they are immersed in a dark, elegant interface complemented by a custom-designed background image that reflects a sophisticated sense of modern web aesthetics.

One of the most defining features of this website is its interactive navigation system. The top navigation bar is fixed, making it easy for users to explore different sections of the site without losing their place. On mobile and smaller screens, unnecessary nav links are automatically hidden to reduce clutter, with a clean hamburger menu that toggles a sleek side panel—ensuring accessibility and functionality across all devices.

The design emphasizes minimalism and contrast, using dark backgrounds, vibrant hover effects, and center-aligned text to ensure readability and user focus. This design also provides an ideal layout for task-based content, portfolio sections, or blog entries without overwhelming the user.
